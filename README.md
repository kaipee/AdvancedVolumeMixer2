AdvancedVolumeMixer2
====================

A fork of the Advanced Volume Mixer Gnome Extension.
This was forked because the original had not been updated since Fri, 27 Dec 2013 21:54:50 (time of fork Thu 17 Jul 00:51:59 BST 2014).

## Foreword
Please note that I am not overly familiar with JS or Gnome Shell development, however I thought it was about time someone made this amazing extension available on Git so that it could be 
forked and kept updated.

I will modify and test this so that it works for each new version of Gnome Shell.

I am willing to accept commits to this extension so as to keep it working (or even hand it over to someone who has more skills).

## Installation

Simply clone this repository then issue **make** command from inside AdvancedVolumeMixer2 directory. This will build a ZIP file which you can install using Gnome Tweak Tool.

### Gnome Shell Version

Currently tested and working on Gnome Shell 3.12.2 (Arch Linux).

#### Original

https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/212/advanced-volume-mixer/
http://repo.or.cz/w/AdvancedVolumeMixer.git

*Please note that I have previously attempted to contact the original developer of this extension on a few occasions with regard to keeping it up to date or forking it - with no response on 
any occasion.*

If you are the original developer and wish to have this repo removed please get in touch.
