AdvancedVolumeMixer2
====================

A fork of the Advanced Volume Mixer Gnome Extension.
This was forked because the original had not been updated since Fri, 27 Dec 2013 21:54:50 (time of fork Thu 17 Jul 00:51:59 BST 2014).

# Foreword
Please note that I am not overly familiar with JS or Gnome Shell development, however I thought it was about time someone made this amazing extension available on Git so that it could be 
forked and kept updated.

I will modify and test this so that it works for each new version of Gnome Shell.

I am willing to accept commits to this extension so as to keep it working (or even hand it over to someone who has more skills).

## Original

*Please note that I have previously attempted to contact the original developer of this extension on a few occasions with regard to keeping it up to date or forking it - with no response on 
any occasion.*
